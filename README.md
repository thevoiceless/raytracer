# CSCI441 Project 1

## Compilation and Usage
To compile, simply run "make". This will create a single "raytrace" executable.
There are two ways to run the raytracer:
	1. Run "./raytrace" with no command-line arguments; This will automatically look for an input file named "input.txt" in the current directory.
	2. Run "./raytrace input_file_name" where "input_file_name" is the full (including the file extension) name of a file in the current directory to use as input.
